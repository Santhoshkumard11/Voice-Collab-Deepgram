There is so much you can do with your voice but you need the right tools to make it happen as you like, this is where [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/signup) comes into play. You get Real-Time speech-to-text translation.

### Overview of My Submission
[Voice Collab Deepgram](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sandy-codes-py.voice-collab-deepgram) is a VS Code extension that Lets you harness the power of voice to collaborate and interact with your code and the people you work with. Often as a software developer, you might feel like you're alone (at least I feel that way when I work on hackathon projects or working on something intense) so this extension not only gets the voice input but also talks with you. For every action phrase that it triggered there is voice feedback so it makes the experience more humanly.
